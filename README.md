# Video Game Storage Creator

About this project
------------------
For my ICS4U culminating, we were tasked to create a program that meets these requirements:
- Being Object Oriented
- Using Arrays (1D and 2D)
- Handle File I/O (Reading and writing text files)
- Search and sort data
- Using an external Python module
- Solving a problem

I decided to create a program that lets the user create their own video game storage.
It is organized by name, platform and genre.

Although it wasn't the best, I was still able to achieve a decent mark out of it.

I may or may not update these scripts in the future.

How to execute
--------------
Make sure you running on Python3. ~~and have the python module progressbar2 installed.~~ (This module is not used, refer to [commit](https://github.com/Speedy905/Video-Game-Storage-Creator/commit/2953dedb6b5ea054e005173ee637ccb072908ccc) for more details.)

Download all the files, leaving them the way it is, and then start the program by running [starthere.py](starthere.py)
