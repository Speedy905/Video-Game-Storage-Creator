# Video Game Storage Creator

About this project
------------------
For my ICS4U culminating, we were tasked to create a program that meets these requirements:

a. Being Object Oriented

b. Using Arrays (1D and 2D)

c. Handle File I/O (Reading and writing text files)

d. Search and sort data

e. Using an external Python module

f. Solving a problem

I decided to create a program that lets the user create their own video game storage.
It is organized by name, platform and genre.

Although it wasn't the best, I was still able to achieve a decent mark out of it.

I may or may not update these scripts in the future.

How to execute
--------------
Make sure you running on Python3, and have the python module progressbar2 installed.

Download all the files, leaving them the way it is, and then start the program by running [starthere.py](starthere.py)
